We recruit, train, and support transformational candidates up and down the ballot — and run them to win.  \\n\\n\\n\\nWe believe that no matter where we come from or what our color, most of us want the same things. We want to earn enough to thrive, not just survive, and leave a better future for our kids. We want healthy food and clean water, safe neighborhoods and a safe world. We want to be free.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Working Families Party is regular people coming together across our differences to make a better future for us all. We’re a multiracial party that fights for workers over bosses and people over the powerful. We want an America which realizes the promise – unrealized in our history – of freedom and equality for all.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Working Families Party is seeking an Analytics Engineer to build the analytics infrastructure needed to fuel the Working Families Party’s mission to build the political home for the many, not the few.

This includes electoral dashboards for key races, coordinated campaigns, fundraising, our ladder of engagement, and volunteers.  \\n\\nWork closely with WFP organizers to identify data needs and be responsive to incoming data requests through the Data Team’s ticketing system. \\n\\nServe as a utility player who can pitch in on analytics projects when needed.\\n\\nOther technical duties as directed by the Data Director.\\n\\nSkills and Qualifications\\n\\nAt least three years of professional experience; 1+ years of experience with dbt.\\n\\nIntermediate to Advanced SQL, including an intuition for modeling data and an understanding of query performance. \\n\\nExperience using git and other command line tools.\\n\\nAt least one full political cycle working in a data analysis role for a campaign or advocacy group.\\n\\nOur tech stack includes:CRMs including EveryAction, Action Network, AV VAN, and PDI.\\n\\nOur own voter contact database, Votivate.\\n\\nDigital tools like Scale to Win, Reach, and Mobilize.\\n\\nRedshift data warehousing.\\n\\nBusiness intelligence tools like Looker Studio and Hex. \\n\\nPrefect for orchestration. \\n\\nNice to haves:Prior experience with systems like NGP/VAN, calling & texting tools, and data tools commonly used in the progressive movement is helpful.\\n\\nAn understanding of voter file and voter contact data. \\n\\nExperience using Python or another scripting language for data transformation and analysis.\\n\\nFamiliarity with Prefect or another non-Civis orchestration tool. \\n\\nUnderstanding of unit testing, CI/CD, and other software engineering best practices.\\n\\nWhat Else Should You Know\\n\\nCompensation: The salary range for this position is $70,000 to $105,000. The final salary will be determined based on an internal equitable scale that takes into consideration years of experience, geographic location, and final job description. We also offer a robust benefit package for full time employees including paid time off; health, dental, vision, and life insurance; flexible spending accounts; retirement plan options; professional development funding; and remote work support.\\n\\nLocation: The position is full-time and remotely based anywhere in the United States. \\n\\nSchedule: Full Time, Permanent \\n\\nUnion Affiliation: WFP is a unionized workplace.
